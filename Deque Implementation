PROBLEM: Some operations of deque-
         1. pb: query to push back the element x.
         2. pf: query to push element x(given with query) to the front of the deque.
         3. pp_b(): query to delete element from the back of the deque.
         4. f: query to return a front element from the deque.

Example 1:

          Input:
          5
          pf 5
          pf 10
          pb 6
          f
          pp_b

          Output: 
          10

Explanation: 
            1. After push front deque will be {5}
            2. After push front deque will be {10, 5}
            3. After push back deque will be {10, 5, 6}
            4. Return front element which is 10
            5. After pop back deque will be {10, 5}


SOLUTION:


void push_back_pb(deque<int> &dq, int x)
{ 
    dq.push_back(x);
}


void pop_back_ppb(deque<int> &dq)
{    
    if(!dq.empty())  dq.pop_back();
    else
        return;
      
}


int front_dq(deque<int> &dq)
{
    if(!dq.empty()) return dq.front();
    else{
        return -1;
    }
    
}


void push_front_pf(deque<int> &dq, int x)
{
    dq.push_front(x);
}
